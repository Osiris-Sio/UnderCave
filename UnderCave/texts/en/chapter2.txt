The room is dark. After entering, the door is violently closed behind you. 
The torches lighten up one by one to reveal at he center, a Cyclops, sitting on a pile of skulls. 
His menacing and blood-curdling aura make you full of fear. He stands up and walks to you. You see a room behind him, where he couldn't follow you. 
You win 25G and 2 Healing Potion. 
Game Over… 
You got to a chess themed room, you see giant statues looking like chess pieces. 
 A poster is on the wall in front of you, its written : 
"In the chess war, the bishop got saved by the knight. The queen thanked him, under the watch of the rook." 
Behind every statue, you found numbers : 
-> 1 behind the queen 
-> 2 behind the rook 
-> 3 behind the bishop 
-> 4 behind the knight
